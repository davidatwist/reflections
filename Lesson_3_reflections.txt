When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to share your work with others of when you want others to add to your project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If you hae other people contributing to your project you would probably want to see what changes were going to be pulled and make sure you agree rather than having Git automatically pull them.
